Migrate 2.0 Release Candidate 1
===============================

- #1005090 - Support multiple values for file fields.
- #996086 - Add prepareRollback and completeRollback methods for entities.

Let a node migration set node_revisions.uid. That's the 'last edited by' user

Migrate 2.0 Beta 3
==================

Features and enhancements

- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:
  All modules implementing migration classes must now implement hook_migrate_api()
    (see migrate_migrate_api() for an example).
  Dependencies and sourceMigrations must now be expressed in terms of 
    machine name rather than class name.
  MigrationBase::getInstance now takes a machine name rather than a class name. 
  Migration class names are no longer required to end in 'Migration'.
- #992898 - Pass options to source and destination constructors as arrays.
File destinations (i.e., migrating directly to the file_managed table, with
  option copying of the files themselves) are now supported.
Allow migration of comment enable/disable.
Check max_execution_time as well as memory_limit, for graceful exit when
  max_execution_time is in play.
Add dedupe() method for a field mapping.
Apply MigrateBase::timestamp() to comment created/changed

Bug fixes

needs_update => needs-update to match drush conventions.

- #984336 - Additional fields and vocabularies not reported on migration info page
- #990960 - Initialize fields array for profiles
- #993684 - hook_requirements should always return array.

Migrate 2.0 Beta 1
