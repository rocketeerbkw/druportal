The Migrate module provides a flexible framework for migrating content into Drupal 
from other sources (e.g., when converting a web site from another CMS to Drupal). 
Out-of-the-box, support for creating Drupal nodes, taxonomy terms, comments, and 
users are included. Plugins permit migration of other types of content.

Usage
-----
For now, all we offer is documentation by example. Enable the migrate_example module and browse to 
admin/migrate to see its dashboard. The data for this migration is in migrate_example/beer.inc.
Mimic that file in order to specify your own migrations. All imports/rollbacks/etc. are initiated
by drush commands.

The Migrate module itself has support for migration into core objects. Support
for migration involving contrib modules is in the migrate_extras module. 

Upgrading
---------
Do not attempt to upgrade directly from Migrate 1 to Migrate 2! There is no
automated path to upgrade - your migrations (formerly known as "content sets")
must be reimplemented from scratch. It is recommended that projects using
Migrate 1 stay with Migrate 1, and that Migrate 2 be used for any new migration
projects.
