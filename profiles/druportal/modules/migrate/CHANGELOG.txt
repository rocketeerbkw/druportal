Migrate 1.0
===========
Bug fixes
- #712752 - Fix missing semicolons on export
- #704768 - Fix default_value nullability

Migrate 1.0 RC1
===========
Features and enhancements
- #484404 - Basic content set export feature added
- #698178 - Add unique alphanumeric ids to content sets
- #679216, #678378 - Implement hook_migrate_api(), and move contrib module support
    to migrate_extras.
- #682762 - Extend separator length

Bug fixes
- #685116 - Missing fields for mapping with missing view argument
- #683402 - Errors saving non-desttype destinations in strict mode

Migrate 1.0 Beta 4
===========
Features and enhancements
- #429306 - Support for content sets designed to update existing objects
    Note a slight change to the migrate_fields hook API - the primary key of
    destination objects should now be [bracketed]. If you have written any code
    to retrieve fields from the hook, you need to be aware of this and will probably
    need to strip the brackets.
- #638770 - Add status field to comments
- #661934 - Support for external tables using views/tw dbname.tablename support
- #670838 - Add status to user fields
- #669358 - Add input format to node fields
- #648276 - Help on using external tables as sources
- #661844 - Display PHP config values on settings page
- #661942 - Redirect to dashboard after content set submit
- #650472 - Major workflow refactoring, page rearrangement:
     Content set list and dashboard pages have been combined.
     UI considerably simplified.
     Support for stopping active processes/clearing stuck status flags added to
       drush (drush migrate stop) and dashboard page.
     Interactive imports now support an update option (previously added to drush with
       the --update flag).
     Processing functions now recognize if memory usage is approaching the limit and
       return cleanly. Interactive runs will automatically start a new batch - drush
       support for resumption is TBI.
     Using the dashboard page to define a default workflow has been removed, along
       with the "drush migrate all" command and cron processing. Using drush, you can
       define a workflow simply with a sequence of drush commands. Cron processing
       requires a means of defining what tasks to perform in cron before it can be
       restored.
     Tools page (deleting all nodes of a given type) removed. This is supported by
       the "drush migrate wipe" command - if you really need to do this via a browser,
       views_bulk_operations is recommended.
- #648952 - Add drush migrate stop command
- #649368 - Add --all option to drush commands

Migrate 1.0 Beta 2
===========
- #566562 - Objects not being passed by reference to prepare and complete hooks
- #566588 - Provide public API functions for map and message table names.
            _migrate_map_table_name() and _migrate_message_table_name() are now
            deprecated.

Migrate 1.0 Beta 1
===========

IMPORTANT!

If you have been using a pre-beta version of the migrate module, please note that
shortly before the release of beta 1 some refactoring was done that requires manual attention.

Updating from a version before 2009/08/23:

All hook names containing "destination" no longer contain "destination". The update function
will attempt to identify hook implementations you will need to rename, but please go through
your code carefully to make sure there's nothing else that needs to change. Also, the content
set pages are now under admin/content/migrate/content_sets (rather than
admin/content/migrate/destinations).

The map and message table names have been renamed. If you have constructed any views
specifically accessing these tables, the views will need to be reconstructed.

Updating from a version before 2009/08/18:

The way content_profile mappings are stored has changed - if you are migrating users
using content_profile, you must edit your user content sets and reestablish your mappings
to any content_profile fields.
